 When we have clone to the url of our git repository the we need to check the status again.
When we check the status again if we have made any file under that folder where we have clone the git repository then it will show (git add .'filename') command to add file there.
 After thaat when we check the repository with git status command it will show (nothing to commit) as the uploaded file has move from the staging area to the git local server.
 After that page is refresh and the file is being added to the git repository.
